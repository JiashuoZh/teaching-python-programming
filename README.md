# Python Programming Lab Exercises
（《Python 程序设计实验教程》）

## 📌 Introduction
This repository documents my practical work based on *Python Programming Lab Exercises*, with a focus on combining fundamental programming concepts with extended applications.  
While the book provides structured experiments, I expand each topic with additional examples, critical reflections, and research-oriented tasks.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Master core Python syntax and programming constructs.
- Develop problem-solving skills through structured lab exercises.
- Explore how Python programming supports **data analysis**, **automation**, and **research prototyping**.
- Document both **code** and **reflection notes** for reproducibility.

## 🧠 Reflections & Insights
For each experiment:
- **Code Implementation**: Clean, well-documented, with test cases where applicable.
- **Extended Exploration**: Applying the concept to data-driven research problems.
- **Pitfalls & Debugging Notes**: Common mistakes and how I resolved them.
- **Research Linkage**: Possible relevance to AI, data science, or fintech contexts.

## 🔮 Future Work
- Integrating selected lab projects into a **course teaching portfolio**.
- Creating Jupyter Notebook versions for interactive demonstrations.
- Adding `pytest`-based automated grading scripts for teaching use.
