# Reflection — Understanding the “Invisible Layer” of Programming

## 1. Initial Confusion

I think I’m starting to see what confuses me about learning programming languages.  
When I learned **HTML**, every tag gave me instant feedback — I could *see* the result.  
It felt rewarding, visible, even aesthetic.  
But with **Python**, the screen stayed blank unless I pressed *Run* or used *print()*.  
It wasn’t obvious what was happening underneath, and that gap somehow made me doubt whether I actually understood anything.

## 2. Knowing Without Feeling Certain

The truth is, I can already do the coding part — I can run scripts, visualize data, even build small projects.  
But sometimes I still feel like I don’t *know what I know*.  
Maybe it’s because I never used Python in a long-term professional project; there’s no external feedback loop to prove or challenge my understanding.  
So I keep wondering: am I truly mastering it, or just replaying routines I memorized?

## 3. Teaching as a Mirror

Re-learning Python now, especially while thinking about how to **teach** it, I realize this confusion is not a weakness — it’s a transition.  
It’s the space between comfort and clarity, between repetition and genuine understanding.  
When I teach, I’m forced to explain why things work, not just how.  
And that process exposes the gaps I couldn’t see before.

## 4. Toward Structural Understanding

I’m moving from merely *knowing how to use tools* to *understanding the logic that connects them*.  
It feels vague, even uncomfortable, but I think that’s what genuine learning actually feels like when it’s working.  
Learning to teach Python is, in a way, teaching myself how to think more slowly, to see the invisible structures behind simple commands.
